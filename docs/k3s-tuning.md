# k3s Control Plane Tuning — ghost

Canonical reference for tuning the k3s server on ghost.
Applied once via `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml` and a service restart.
This is not a GitOps manifest — it lives outside ArgoCD's reconciliation scope.

---

## Why

k3s ships with defaults sized for general-purpose clusters. Ghost runs a
five-node homelab cluster (one control-plane + two current workers + up to three
planned Framework desktops) under a KubeVirt + Argo Workflows workload that
creates and destroys many objects quickly. Three defaults cause measurable waste:

**API server watch-cache** is unbounded. Every informer — and ArgoCD, Argo
Workflows, and KubeVirt each run several — reserves cache memory proportional to
object churn. A bounded cache of 100 entries per resource type is sufficient for
this object volume and dramatically reduces idle RSS.

**etcd** does not compact or snapshot automatically. On a busy cluster, the
keyspace grows without limit until etcd slows or hits its quota. Periodic
compaction every hour and a 4 GiB quota cap keep the database healthy without
manual intervention.

**Controller-manager** defaults to 20 concurrent sync workers for Deployments
and ReplicaSets. For five nodes that is 4x more goroutines than useful, burning
CPU and scheduler overhead during Argo burst phases.

## Configuration

Place the following block in `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml` on ghost. The file
is cumulative — if it already exists, merge rather than replace.

```yaml
# /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml on ghost
# Apply once; requires: sudo systemctl restart k3s
# Workers reconnect automatically within ~30s.

kube-apiserver-arg:
  - "default-watch-cache-size=100"
  - "event-ttl=30m"
  - "max-requests-inflight=100"
  - "max-mutating-requests-inflight=50"
  - "profiling=false"

kube-controller-manager-arg:
  - "leader-elect=false"
  - "node-monitor-period=60s"
  - "node-monitor-grace-period=180s"
  - "concurrent-deployment-syncs=2"
  - "concurrent-replicaset-syncs=2"
  - "concurrent-statefulset-syncs=1"
  - "concurrent-gc-syncs=2"

etcd-arg:
  - "auto-compaction-mode=periodic"
  - "auto-compaction-retention=1h"
  - "quota-backend-bytes=4294967296"
  - "heartbeat-interval=250"
  - "election-timeout=2500"

etcd-snapshot-schedule-cron: "0 */12 * * *"
etcd-snapshot-retention: 5
etcd-snapshot-compress: true
```

**Argument notes:**

| Argument | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `default-watch-cache-size` | 100 | Caps per-resource watch-cache entries; still fast for informers on a small cluster |
| `event-ttl` | 30m | Default 1h; events are noisy and short-lived — Argo logs are the durable record |
| `max-requests-inflight` | 100 | Default 400; adequate for five nodes + Argo burst |
| `max-mutating-requests-inflight` | 50 | Default 200; adequate for VM create/delete cycles |
| `profiling` | false | Saves a small amount of CPU; no pprof endpoint needed in production |
| `leader-elect` | false | Single control-plane; disabling saves lease churn |
| `node-monitor-grace-period` | 180s | 3× the monitor period; avoids false `NotReady` on slow VM create phases |
| `concurrent-*-syncs` | 1–2 | Right-sized for five nodes; reduces goroutine pressure during Argo bursts |
| `auto-compaction-retention` | 1h | Compact every hour; prevents keyspace bloat from ephemeral VM objects |
| `quota-backend-bytes` | 4 GiB | Hard cap; etcd logs a warning at 80%; alerts before it blocks writes |
| `heartbeat-interval` | 250ms | Default 100ms; reduces etcd election noise on a LAN |
| `election-timeout` | 2500ms | 10× heartbeat; standard ratio for stable single-node etcd |

## Apply Procedure

1. SSH to ghost (or use a terminal session directly):

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml
   ```

   Merge the block above. If the file does not exist, create it.

2. Restart k3s:

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart k3s
   ```

   The API server is unavailable for roughly 10–15 seconds while etcd and the
   API server restart. Workers lose contact and reconnect automatically; expect
   all nodes `Ready` again within 30 seconds.

3. Verify:

   ```
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   All nodes should report `Ready`. If a worker does not recover within 60
   seconds, check `journalctl -u k3s-agent -n 50` on that worker.

4. Confirm etcd compaction is active:

   ```
   kubectl -n kube-system logs -l component=etcd --tail=20 | grep compact
   ```

   You should see periodic compaction log lines within the first hour.

## What Was Skipped and Why

**`--watch-cache=false`** — Disabling the watch cache entirely forces every
informer to bypass the in-memory cache and read directly from etcd. ArgoCD,
KubeVirt, and Argo Workflows each hold persistent watches across many resource
types; disabling the cache would significantly increase etcd read load and
latency. Bounding the cache size (`default-watch-cache-size=100`) achieves the
memory goal without the etcd penalty.

**Disabling specific controllers** (`--controllers=-attachdetach,-pv-binder`) —
KubeVirt requires both the `attachdetach` and `pv-binder` controllers to manage
disk attachment for VMs. These cannot be disabled without breaking VM
provisioning.

**Cilium CNI migration** — Replacing Flannel with Cilium would reduce kube-proxy
overhead and add eBPF-based network policy. For a five-node homelab under this
workload, the operational complexity of a full CNI migration is not justified by
the marginal gain. Revisit if the cluster grows beyond ten nodes or network
policy becomes a requirement.

**`--disable-kube-proxy`** — Paired with Cilium; not applicable while Flannel is
the CNI.

## Framework Desktop Nodes

When adding Framework laptop or desktop nodes as k3s workers, no changes to this
file are required. Workers join via the standard `K3S_URL` / `K3S_TOKEN`
registration and are immediately schedulable.

The semaphore-tuner CronWorkflow (`manifests/semaphore-tuner.yaml`) recomputes
`max-containerdisk-vms` and `max-hostdisk-vms` slots hourly from live node
allocatable memory. New nodes are reflected automatically within one hour of
joining the cluster. No manual slot edits are needed.

If a Framework node has local NVMe and you want to schedule HostDisk VMs on it,
add `nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/hostname: <nodename>` to the relevant
WorkflowTemplate steps and create the necessary host path directories on that
node.
